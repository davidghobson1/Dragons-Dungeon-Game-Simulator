More Player and Item Details:

Player objects represent the interacting characters in the dungeon, and are divided into three groups: Heroes, Fighters, and Dragons, which each have their own move behaviour in the dungeon. 

The Fighter class further divides into Goblins, Orcs, and Dorcs, with the main difference between these classes being in the player stats (mainly strength).

As mentioned in the Program Overview, Heroes only ever attack Fighters, and Fighters only attack Heroes. Dragons don't attack Fighters, and kill Heroes instantly, and Heroes never deal any damage to a Dragon at this stage.

Item objects represent the items found within the dungeon and are divided into two groups: Potions and Armour. Potions affect a Player's health, whereas Armour influences a Player's strength or armour attribute.

For Potions, Players can either find a Health Potion or a Wicked Potion. 
	- Health Potions help boost a Hero's health, and give them a boost of 1-4 health points, however Health Potions have no effect on a Fighter, who choose to leave the potions where they are.
	- Wicked Potions are Health Potions in disguise. When a Hero drinks them, their health goes down by 1-2 points, and can kill a Hero. Fighters get a health boost from Wicked Potions which increases their health by 1-2 points.

Armour items are divided into two groups as well: Swords and Shields. 
	- Swords affect a Player's strength attribute, and will increase a Hero's strength by 1-4 points, but will decrease a Fighter's strength by half.
	- Shields boost a Player's armour level by 1-3 points for both Heroes and Fighters .

In general, Dragons are too epic for petty things like items, and so Dragons never bother with any item they happen to come across.
