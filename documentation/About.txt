Purpose:
A basic game program simulating heroes' quests to steal the sacred Emerald from the dangerous Dragon's Dungeon.

File Organization:
All header files and source files are located in the 'include' and 'source' directories respectively. The 'source' directory is then further divided into a collection class, control, game objects, user-interface, and an other directory, based on the purpose of the code. 
For more information on the general program architecture, and for an overview on the different classes, please see the ArchitectureAndClassOverviews.txt file in the 'documentation' directory.
